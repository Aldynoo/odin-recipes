This is a webpage with three of my most liked foods. It contains pictures of the foods, ingrediants and steps on how to make. It's written in Slovenian language!
This project is presentation of my current knowledge of HTML.

I gained knowledge and insights of:

Basic boilerplate knowledge and speed typing!
<h1> - <h6> header tags and how to use them.
<p> how to effectively use paragraphs.
<a href> and <img src> + their description tags such as <alt>, <height> and <width>.
<ol>, <ul> and <li> effective use of lists.
