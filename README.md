This project is presentation of my current knowledge of HTML. Knowledge and insight I gained:

1. Basic boilerplate knowledge and speed typing!
2. h1 - h6 -> header tags and how to use them.
3. p -> how to effectively use paragraphs.
4. a href and img src -> + their description tags such as -> alt, height and width.
5. ol, ul and li -> how to use lists so the page looks cleaner.
